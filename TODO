* Allow switching between AABB- and ABAB-grouped multiple conformations.

	Create a tool to set up multiple conformations correctly, and make sure
	it can run in reverse. AABB<->ABAB.

	How can we take advantage of code reuse when we're doing the same process in
	reverse? Probably only in the really basic functions like is_atom() and
	friends, not in the actual processing.

* Re-order atom orders to be consistent (e.g. N-CA-C-O vs N-CA-O-C).

	Design:

		Read in PDB

		Ignore everything but atom info, which includes:
			MODEL, ATOM, SIGATM, ANISOU, SIGUIJ, HETATM, TER, ENDMDL

			In other words, immediately write out anything before or after
			coordinate section.

		Within coordinate section, scan to end of a given residue, then reorder
		it.

			Data structure: Array of arrays
				Primary array is one per coordinate line
					Numbers in thousands
				Secondary array is one per section of a coordinate line:
					0	1-6
					1	7-11
					2	13-16
					3	17
					4	18-20
					5	22
					6	23-26
					7	27
					8	31-38
					9	39-46
					10	47-54
					11	55-60
					12	61-66
					13	74-76
					14	77-78
					15	79-80
				Total elements = 16 * ~3,000 = ~50,000

			Do we want to munge multiple conformations first?
				Doing it would simplify this script
				Not doing it would simplify using this script in the middle of
					work fixing multiple conformations. They are typically
					kept grouped together while work is in progress, although
					this is not PDB-compliant.

			How to reorder? Find backbone, just reorder that section, then toss
				the sidechain on afterwards without reordering. Backbone should
				always be the first four atoms: N CA C O.

				Find beginning of residue, so we can find the first four atoms.
				Scan down array to find the first four atoms. There could be
					weird cruft in the middle that we need to allow for as
					well, like ANISOU lines. Those also need to be reordered.
				Find N, print it, remove from options
				Find CA, print it, remove from options
				Find C, print it, remove from options
				Print O, the remaining option -- sanity check for O anyway

		Don't worry about sorting the sidechains, at least for now. Just spit
			them out the same as they came in.

* Add filter.sh to pre-filter by B, so we don't waste time on those atoms.
